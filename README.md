## WORKSHOP

IDEA -> Let's make a super simple weather appplication that runs on the web. You type in the name of a city and get the current temperature for that city. 

### INGREDIENTS
To make this application, we're going to need to cover the following topics:
  * HTML -> The information represented on the page.
  * CSS -> The style or look of the information.
  * Javacsript -> The programming language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage.
